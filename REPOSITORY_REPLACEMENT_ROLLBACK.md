## How to Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to restore the old BenKassan/newsglide code, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Restore Old State)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/Users/elliotgreenbaum/NewsGlide Sep 2025"

# Force push the backup branch back to main
git push benkassan backup-before-replacement-2025-10-10:main --force
```

This will instantly restore the old state (commit `7e1b43a`).

### Option 2: Clean Rollback (Create Revert Commit)

If you want to preserve history instead of force pushing:

```bash
# Create a new branch from the backup
git checkout -b restore-old-state benkassan/backup-before-replacement-2025-10-10

# Push this branch to main
git push benkassan restore-old-state:main --force
```

### Option 3: Selective Rollback (Cherry-pick Old Changes)

If you only need specific files or commits from the old version:

```bash
# View commits in the backup
git log benkassan/backup-before-replacement-2025-10-10

# Cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Or checkout specific files
git checkout benkassan/backup-before-replacement-2025-10-10 -- path/to/file
```

---

## Verification After Rollback

After performing a rollback, verify it worked:

```bash
# Check the current state
git fetch benkassan
git log benkassan/main -1 --oneline

# Should show: 7e1b43a (if you used Option 1 or 2)
```

---

## Important Notes

### For Team Members:
If anyone else has cloned BenKassan/newsglide, they will need to:

```bash
# Fetch the new state
git fetch origin

# Reset their local main to match
git reset --hard origin/main

# Or simply re-clone the repository
```

### Branch Protection:
- If rollback fails with "protected branch" error, temporarily disable branch protection on GitHub:
  1. Go to: https://github.com/BenKassan/newsglide/settings/branches
  2. Disable protection rules for `main`
  3. Perform rollback
  4. Re-enable protection

### Backup Safety:
- The backup branch `backup-before-replacement-2025-10-10` will remain available indefinitely
- You can always restore from it at any time
- Backup commit: `7e1b43a6ebdd6d1393a9e6c017addd5d875950b3`

## Contact & Support

If you encounter any issues with rollback:
1. Check that the backup branch still exists: `git ls-remote --heads benkassan | grep backup`
2. Verify you have push access to BenKassan/newsglide
3. Ensure branch protection is disabled if force push fails

---

## Cleanup (Optional)

After confirming the replacement is working correctly, you can optionally:

```bash
# Remove the local backup branch (remote backup remains)
git branch -d backup-before-replacement-2025-10-10

# Remove the benkassan remote if no longer needed
git remote remove benkassan
```

**Note:** Keep the backup branch on GitHub for safety. Only delete locally if needed.
