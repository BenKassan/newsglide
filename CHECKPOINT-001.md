# CHECKPOINT-001.md - Post-Migration State

**Date:** 2025-07-08  
**Commit:** 6607629 (Merge remote changes - keeping local improvements)  
**Claude Code Session:** Migration Documentation Creation

## Checkpoint Summary

This checkpoint captures the state of the codebase after:
1. Migration from Lovable to Claude Code
2. Merge of local improvements with remote repository
3. Creation of comprehensive migration documentation

## Current State

### Architecture
- Feature-based modular architecture fully implemented
- Clear separation between features, shared resources, and UI components
- TypeScript path aliases configured for clean imports
- All sensitive data moved to environment variables

### Documentation
- REWRITE.md created with comprehensive migration details
- CLAUDE.md with workflow instructions
- PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md with technical architecture
- TEST_AI_IMPROVEMENTS.md for AI testing guide
- TODO.md for task tracking

### Development Infrastructure
- ESLint + Prettier configured
- Husky pre-commit hooks active
- Commitlint for conventional commits
- Vitest testing framework set up
- Build optimization with Vite

### AI Improvements
- Temperature settings adjusted for more natural output
- Post-processing to remove AI-sounding phrases
- Enhanced prompts for better content quality

### Known Issues
- Duplicate directory structures exist (legacy from migration)
- Some components exist in both old and new locations
- Cleanup needed for full migration completion

## Files Modified in This Session

### Created
- `/REWRITE.md` - Comprehensive migration documentation
- `/CHECKPOINT-001.md` - This checkpoint file

### Modified
- None in this session (documentation only)

## Next Steps
1. Remove duplicate directory structures
2. Consolidate all components to new locations
3. Update remaining import paths
4. Run full test suite to ensure stability

## Environment Variables Required
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=optional_voice_id
```

- Supabase 2.50.2
- OpenAI 5.7.0
- TanStack Query 5.56.2
- Radix UI components (30+)
- Vitest 3.2.4

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests: Setup complete, minimal coverage
