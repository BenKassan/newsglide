Instructions:
1. Generate a natural debate with 6-8 exchanges (flexible if the flow demands it)
2. Each speaker should sound authentic to their real personality
3. Reference the news naturally - don't force exact quotes
4. Include realistic elements:
   - Interruptions ("Wait, hold on...")
   - Verbal tics and filler words appropriate to each speaker
   - Natural transitions and reactions
   - Some responses can be very short ("That's absurd!")
   - Others can be longer when making a point
5. Don't force exact word counts - let responses be as long or short as feels natural
6. Make it feel like a real conversation, not a scripted exchange
