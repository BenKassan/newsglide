# NewsGlide "Try" Section Enhancement - Live Major News Headlines

## Problem Analysis
The current "Try" section shows generic trending topics fetched from Brave Search API using simple queries. The topics are too broad ("Tech industry news", "Political news") instead of specific current stories. The refresh button exists but doesn't provide meaningfully different suggestions. Topics currently refresh every hour but should be every 10 minutes for base suggestions.

## Requirements
1. Fetch real headlines from major news outlets (CNN, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, NYT, BBC, AP News)
2. Convert headlines to searchable topics (e.g., "Biden announces climate plan" ‚Üí "Biden climate initiative")
3. 10-minute cache for base topics that users see on first page load
4. Refresh button functionality that shows different current topics from the same time period
5. Target front-page stories from major newspapers, not just generic news searches

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Edge Function (supabase/functions/trending-topics/index.ts)
- [ ] Replace generic "latest" search with targeted queries for major outlets
- [ ] Implement multiple outlet targeting (CNN, WSJ, Reuters, NYT, BBC, AP)
- [ ] Enhance headline extraction and topic conversion logic
- [ ] Add 10-minute server-side caching mechanism
- [ ] Implement topic rotation for refresh requests

### Phase 2: Service Layer Updates (src/services/openaiService.ts)
- [ ] Update fetchTrendingTopics() to handle refresh vs initial load
- [ ] Add refresh parameter to request different topics from same batch
- [ ] Improve error handling and fallback topics

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates (src/pages/Index.tsx)
- [ ] Change interval from 60 minutes to 10 minutes for auto-refresh
- [ ] Update refresh button to get different topics from same batch
- [ ] Enhance loading states and error handling

## Technical Approach

### Enhanced News Source Targeting
Instead of generic "latest" searches, target specific major outlets:
- CNN.com breaking news and top stories
- WSJ.com front page business news
- Reuters top international stories
- NYT front page news
- BBC News headlines
- AP News trending stories

### Headline-to-Topic Conversion Strategy
Transform actual headlines into searchable topics:
- "Biden announces new climate initiative" ‚Üí "Biden climate initiative"
- "Tesla stock drops after earnings miss" ‚Üí "Tesla earnings report"
- "Russia-Ukraine latest developments" ‚Üí "Russia Ukraine conflict"
- "Fed raises interest rates amid inflation" ‚Üí "Federal Reserve interest rates"

### 10-Minute Caching Strategy
- **Server-side cache**: Store multiple topic batches with timestamps
- **Topic rotation**: Return different topics from same 10-minute batch on refresh
- **Fallback system**: High-quality backup topics for API failures

### Success Criteria
- Topics reflect actual current front-page stories from major outlets
- Refresh button shows genuinely different trending topics
- Initial page load uses 10-minute cached topics
- Better topic quality (specific, current, searchable)
- Improved error handling and fallbacks

## Files Modified
1. `supabase/functions/trending-topics/index.ts` - Enhanced news fetching and caching
2. `src/services/openaiService.ts` - Refresh functionality  
3. `src/pages/Index.tsx` - 10-minute interval and improved UX

## Security Considerations
- All API keys properly secured in Supabase secrets
- No sensitive information exposed in frontend
- Proper CORS headers maintained
- Input sanitization for all user-facing content

## Testing Plan
1. Verify topics match current major news headlines
2. Test refresh shows different but equally current topics
3. Confirm 10-minute refresh intervals work properly
4. Test fallback behavior when APIs fail

## Security Review ‚úÖ

### Security Best Practices Implemented
1. **API Key Protection**: All API keys properly secured in Supabase secrets, never exposed in frontend
2. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs and API responses properly sanitized and validated
3. **CORS Headers**: Proper CORS configuration maintained for edge function
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose system internals
5. **Cache Security**: In-memory cache with proper data validation, no sensitive data stored
6. **Request Validation**: All edge function requests properly validated and parsed

### No Vulnerabilities Identified
- No sensitive information exposed on frontend
- No SQL injection vectors (using Supabase client methods)
- No XSS vulnerabilities (proper content sanitization)
- No unauthorized API access possible

## Implementation Review

### What Was Changed

#### 1. Enhanced Edge Function (`supabase/functions/trending-topics/index.ts`)
**Major Improvements:**
- **Targeted News Fetching**: Instead of generic "latest" searches, now targets specific major outlets (CNN, WSJ, Reuters, NYT, BBC, AP News) using site-specific queries
- **Smart Headline Conversion**: Implemented `convertHeadlineToTopic()` function that transforms news headlines into searchable topics by:
  - Removing source attribution and unnecessary words
  - Simplifying complex sentences to key concepts  
  - Limiting length to 4-5 essential words
  - Example: "Biden announces new climate initiative" ‚Üí "Biden climate initiative"
- **10-Minute Caching System**: Added intelligent caching with `topicCache` Map that:
  - Stores 8 quality topics for rotation
  - Serves cached results for 10 minutes
  - Enables refresh functionality without new API calls
- **Topic Rotation**: When refresh is requested, returns different topics from the same 10-minute batch using randomization

#### 2. Service Layer Updates (`src/services/openaiService.ts`)
**Enhanced Functionality:**
- **Refresh Parameter**: Added `refresh` boolean parameter to `fetchTrendingTopics()` function
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved fallback topics with more specific, current-sounding alternatives
- **API Communication**: Updated to send refresh parameter to edge function for topic rotation

#### 3. Frontend Updates (`src/pages/Index.tsx`)
**User Experience Improvements:**
- **10-Minute Auto-Refresh**: Changed interval from 60 minutes to 10 minutes for fresher content
- **Enhanced Refresh Button**: Now requests different topics from same batch and shows success toast
- **Better Loading States**: Maintained existing loading animations while improving functionality

### How It Works

#### Topic Fetching Flow
1. **Initial Load**: App fetches fresh topics from major news outlets every 10 minutes
2. **Caching**: Edge function stores 8 best topics, displays first 4
3. **Refresh**: When user clicks refresh, gets different 4 topics from same cached batch
4. **Fallbacks**: Multiple layers of fallback topics if APIs fail

#### Headline-to-Topic Conversion Process
1. **Source Removal**: Strips publication names and attributions
2. **Content Cleaning**: Removes quotes, excess whitespace, and filler words
3. **Concept Extraction**: Focuses on key subjects and actions
4. **Length Optimization**: Ensures topics are searchable but not too long

#### Caching Strategy
- **Server-Side Cache**: 10-minute TTL with topic rotation capability
- **Memory Efficient**: Stores only essential data structures
- **Refresh Logic**: Distinguishes between cache refresh and topic rotation

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **API Failures**: Multiple fallback topic sets with current, realistic topics
2. **Empty Results**: Robust error handling with meaningful fallback content  
3. **Cache Expiration**: Smooth transition between cached and fresh content
4. **Topic Quality**: Filters out meta-news content and ensures substantial topics
5. **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate topics within same response

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Real Headlines**: Topics now reflect actual current stories from major outlets
2. **10-Minute Freshness**: Much more current than previous 60-minute refresh
3. **Meaningful Refresh**: Users get genuinely different topics when refreshing
4. **Better Searchability**: Topics are optimized for news synthesis search
5. **Improved Fallbacks**: Higher quality backup topics when APIs fail

### Potential Future Enhancements
1. **Personalization**: Could adapt topics based on user search history
2. **Regional Focus**: Could add location-based topic filtering
3. **Breaking News Priority**: Could boost very recent stories
4. **Category Filtering**: Could allow users to choose topic categories

The enhanced system now provides users with current, specific, and varied trending topics that reflect real headlines from major news outlets, updating every 10 minutes with the ability to refresh for different current stories.
