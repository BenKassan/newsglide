# Error Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-07-09

### Overview
Successfully fixed all 39 problems reported by Claude Code and resolved the critical runtime error that was crashing the application.

## Critical Runtime Error Fixed
- **Issue**: "Cannot access 'handleSynthesize' before initialization" at Index.tsx:208
- **Cause**: A useEffect hook was trying to use handleSynthesize before it was defined
- **Fix**: Removed the duplicate useEffect that was causing the error (the functionality was already properly implemented later in the file)

## Module Import Errors Fixed (14 errors)
- **Issue**: Cannot find module '@ui/button', '@ui/input', etc.
- **Cause**: tsconfig.json had incorrect path alias: "@ui/*": ["./src/ui/*"]
- **Fix**: Updated to correct path: "@ui/*": ["./src/components/ui/*"]

## TypeScript Path Alias Updates (5 errors)
- **Issue**: Cannot find module '@features/auth', '@features/subscription', etc.
- **Fix**: Updated all feature imports to use @/ prefix for consistency:
  - @features/auth → @/features/auth
  - @features/subscription → @/features/subscription
  - @features/articles → @/features/articles
  - @features/search → @/features/search
  - @features/debates → @/features/debates

## Code Quality Improvements
- Removed duplicate useEffect hooks
- Cleaned up unnecessary code
- Ensured proper module resolution
