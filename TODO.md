## Migration Strategy (If Ever Needed)

### Next.js Migration Path (Future Option)

If you ever need SSR for specific use cases:

1. Keep current app as-is
2. Create separate Next.js app for public content
3. Share component library between apps
4. Use micro-frontend architecture
5. Gradually migrate features if needed

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Bundle size < 200KB (gzipped)
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] TypeScript coverage > 95%
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Zero accessibility violations
- [ ] Build time < 30 seconds
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] All features working in restructured code

---

## Notes

- Each phase can be completed independently
- Prioritize Phase 1 & 2 for immediate impact
- Phase 3-7 can be done in parallel by different team members
- Keep the app functional throughout the restructuring
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Create feature branches for each major change

## Implementation Progress & Details (Updated: 2025-01-06)

### Session Summary

This document tracks the comprehensive 7-phase restructuring plan for NewsGlide (fact-fuse-news-forge). The plan was created to improve code organization, security, performance, and developer experience while maintaining the existing Vite SPA architecture.

### Completed Work in This Session

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Security

1. **Prettier Configuration**
   - Created `.prettierrc` with standard settings (no semicolons, single quotes, etc.)
   - Created `.prettierignore` for build outputs and generated files
   - Removed duplicate `.prettierrc.json` file

2. **Husky & Git Hooks**
   - Initialized Husky for git hooks
   - Configured commit-msg hook for commitlint
   - Updated pre-commit hook to use lint-staged instead of npm test

3. **Lint-Staged Configuration**
   - Already had `.lintstagedrc.json` configured
   - Runs ESLint and Prettier on staged files

#### Phase 2: Code Architecture

- **Note**: Most of Phase 2 was already completed in previous sessions
- Directory structure already follows feature-based architecture
- All features properly organized in `src/features/`

#### Phase 3: Performance Optimizations

1. **Bundle Optimization (vite.config.ts)**
   - Added manual chunk splitting for vendor libraries
   - Configured separate chunks for: react-vendor, ui-vendor, form-vendor, date-vendor, utils
   - Set chunk size warning limit to 1000KB
   - Enabled source maps for development only
   - Configured terser minification with console/debugger removal in production
   - Added optimizeDeps configuration

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - **SavedArticles.tsx**: Added React.memo, useCallback for all handlers, useMemo for getAllTags
   - **DebateViewer.tsx**: Added React.memo, moved pure functions outside component, useCallback for handleShare, useMemo for word count calculation
   - **SearchHistory.tsx**: Identified for optimization but not completed

3. **Data Fetching with React Query**
   - Configured QueryClient with optimal defaults (5min stale time, 10min cache time)
   - Created `useSavedArticles` hook with React Query integration
   - Created `useSearchHistory` hook with React Query integration
   - Both hooks include proper error handling and toast notifications

4. **SEO Implementation**
   - Installed react-helmet-async
   - Added HelmetProvider to App.tsx
   - Created reusable SEO component with Open Graph and Twitter meta tags
   - Added SEO component to Index page

### Important Technical Decisions

1. **React Query Configuration**
   - Disabled refetch on window focus to prevent unnecessary API calls
   - Set retry attempts to 1 with exponential backoff
   - Separate stale times for different data types

2. **Performance Patterns**
   - Used React.memo for components with expensive renders
   - Moved pure functions outside components to prevent recreations
   - Applied useCallback to event handlers passed as props
   - Used useMemo for expensive computations (getAllTags, word counts)

3. **Code Splitting Strategy**
   - All pages use lazy loading with Suspense
   - Vendor chunks organized by functionality
   - Terser removes console/debugger in production

### Potential Issues & Considerations

1. **Missing Terser Dependency**
   - vite.config.ts references terser but it may not be installed
   - Vite might include it by default, needs verification

2. **TypeScript Path Aliases**
   - Already configured in vite.config.ts
   - All imports use @ aliases correctly

3. **React Query Migration**
   - Created hooks but components still use direct API calls
   - Future work: Update components to use the new hooks

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - No tools currently set up to measure impact of optimizations
   - Consider adding React DevTools Profiler integration

### Next Steps for Future Sessions

1. **Complete Phase 3**
   - Add skeleton loaders
   - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
   - Add structured data for SEO
   - Analyze bundle with rollup-plugin-visualizer

2. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Set up Vitest
   - Write tests for new React Query hooks
   - Add integration tests for critical flows

3. **Phase 5: Developer Experience**
   - Update README with new patterns
   - Document React Query usage
   - Create component generation scripts

4. **Update Components to Use New Hooks**
   - Migrate SavedArticles to use useSavedArticles hook
   - Migrate SearchHistory to use useSearchHistory hook
   - This will complete the React Query integration

### File Structure Context

The project follows this structure:

```
