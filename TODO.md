# TODO: Enhance Glidey Mascot with Speech Bubble

## Requirements
1. Add a speech bubble coming out of Glidey's mouth saying "Click me!"
2. Keep "Glide With Purpose" centered on the page
3. Position Glidey next to "Glide With Purpose" without interfering with the centering
4. Add enhanced hover effects for Glidey
5. Add a period to "Glide With Purpose" so it becomes "Glide With Purpose."

## Plan

### Task 1: Add period to title text
- [ ] Update line 1803 to change "Glide With Purpose" to "Glide With Purpose."

### Task 2: Create speech bubble component
- [ ] Add speech bubble element positioned absolutely near Glidey's mouth
- [ ] Use professional, subtle styling (not garish)
- [ ] Implement tasteful fade-in animation
- [ ] Ensure speech bubble is responsive and works on different screen sizes

### Task 3: Enhance hover effects
- [ ] Add pulse animation to speech bubble on hover
- [ ] Improve existing scale effect (currently scale-110)
- [ ] Add smooth transitions for all hover states
- [ ] Consider adding a subtle glow effect

### Task 4: Ensure responsive design
- [ ] Test speech bubble positioning at different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify title remains centered across all breakpoints
- [ ] Ensure Glidey and speech bubble work well on mobile (currently hidden on md:block)

## Design Approach
- Use clean, minimal speech bubble design with subtle shadow
- Apply professional color scheme (avoid bright/neon colors)
- Use smooth, premium animations (no bouncing or jarring effects)
- Ensure accessibility (proper contrast, semantic HTML)
