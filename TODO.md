- [ ] Create queue management service functions
- [ ] Add UI element to show queued recommendations
- [ ] Display queue after search completion
- [ ] Allow queue reordering and deletion

### Phase 5: Update Post-Survey Flow
- [ ] Remove automatic search redirect
- [ ] Show RecommendationSelector instead
- [ ] Update navigation flow after selection
- [ ] Ensure smooth transition to search results

### Phase 6: Enhance Recommendation Generation
- [ ] Update generateContextualRecommendations for 3-question format
  - [ ] Update interface to use new format: interests (up to 5), usage (up to 3), style (single)
  - [ ] Create more contextual topic mappings based on combinations
  - [ ] Generate more specific recommendations based on usage patterns
  - [ ] Add style-aware recommendation generation
- [ ] Ensure AI actually uses survey answers meaningfully
- [ ] Add more diverse topic mappings
- [ ] Include explanation for why each recommendation was chosen

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_preferences 
ADD COLUMN recommendation_queue JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
```

### State Management
- Survey completion state in Index.tsx
- Queue state in global context or localStorage
- Selected recommendations tracking

### Component Structure
```
OnboardingSurveyModal (simplified)
  ↓
RecommendationSelector (new)
  ↓
Index.tsx (search execution)
  ↓
QueuedRecommendations (sidebar/modal)
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Survey doesn't reappear on tab switch
- [ ] 3 questions capture user preferences effectively
- [ ] Recommendations are relevant to survey answers
- [ ] Queue persists across sessions
- [ ] Smooth UX flow from survey to search

# TODO: Fix Navigation and UI Issues

## Previous Issues (Completed) ✅
### 1. Remove Duplicate Navigation Bar ✅
- [x] Remove the `Navbar1` component from Routes.tsx that's causing the duplicate navigation
- The pages already have their own navigation (UnifiedNavigation or built-in navigation)

### 2. Fix Profile Icon Cut-off ✅
- [x] Add right padding/margin to the UserMenu component in UnifiedNavigation
- The profile icon appears to be too close to the edge

### 3. Fix White Text on White Background in Discover Survey ✅
- [x] Update the Discover page survey question options to use proper text colors
- Currently using `text-white` on glass-card backgrounds which makes text invisible

---

# Bug Fixes and Changes Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan addresses several key issues:
1. Survey persistence bug - the personalization survey keeps reappearing after completion
2. Moving value propositions from logged-in view to landing page
3. Replacing "The future of news consumption" section with value propositions
4. Adding animations to value propositions

## Tasks

### 1. Fix Survey Persistence Issue ✅
- [x] Debug why `onboarding_completed` flag is not being properly checked or saved
- [x] Ensure survey completion state persists across page refreshes
- [x] Verify the survey modal only appears once for new users
- [x] Fix the "Don't know what to search" link behavior to not re-trigger completed surveys

### 2. Move Value Propositions to Landing Page ✅
- [x] Extract value propositions data from Index.tsx (lines 280-306)
- [x] Import required icons (Shield, User, MessageCircle, Brain) in LandingPage.tsx
- [x] Remove value propositions section from Index.tsx (lines 1797-1824)

### 3. Replace "Future of News Consumption" Section ✅
- [x] Locate the features section in LandingPage.tsx (around line 544)
- [x] Replace the current content with the value propositions
- [x] Maintain the existing glassmorphism styling

### 4. Add Animations to Value Propositions ✅
- [x] Implement staggered fade-in animations for each value prop card
- [x] Add hover effects consistent with landing page design
- [x] Consider using intersection observer for scroll-triggered animations

## Implementation Details

### Survey Persistence Fix
The survey state is managed in Index.tsx using `showOnboardingSurvey` state. The issue appears to be in the authentication flow check around lines 214-236. Need to ensure:
- `onboarding_completed` is properly saved to database
- State is correctly fetched on page load
- Modal doesn't re-trigger on authentication state changes

### Value Propositions Migration
Current location: Index.tsx lines 280-306 (data) and 1797-1824 (rendering)
Target location: LandingPage.tsx features section (replace line 544 content)

### Animation Strategy
Use Tailwind CSS classes with custom delays for staggered animations:
- Initial state: opacity-0, translate-y-4
- Animated state: opacity-100, translate-y-0
- Transition: duration-700, with delays of 100ms, 200ms, 300ms, 400ms

## Notes
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Preserve existing styling and design consistency
- Test thoroughly after each change to ensure no regressions

## Previous Review
All three initial issues have been successfully fixed:

1. **Duplicate Navigation**: Removed Navbar1 from Routes.tsx (lines 3 and 24)
2. **Profile Icon**: Updated UnifiedNavigation container padding to `sm:pr-8`
3. **Survey Text**: Changed text colors from `text-white` to `text-gray-700` and `text-blue-300` to `text-blue-700` in Discover.tsx

## Current Session Review

Successfully completed all requested changes:

### 1. Fixed Survey Persistence Issue
- Removed the `onboardingChecked` state that was preventing re-checks
- Modified the useEffect to always check onboarding status when user is present
- Added explicit state setting to hide survey when already completed
- Survey now properly persists completion state across page refreshes

### 2. Moved Value Propositions to Landing Page
- Successfully migrated all four value propositions from Index.tsx to LandingPage.tsx
- Added required icon imports (User, MessageCircle) to LandingPage.tsx
- Replaced "The future of news consumption" section with "Why Choose NewsGlide?"
- Removed the entire value propositions section and data from Index.tsx

### 3. Enhanced Animations
- Implemented staggered fade-in animations with delays (100ms, 200ms, 300ms, 400ms)
- Enhanced hover effects with:
  - Gradient background on icon containers
  - Scale and shadow effects on hover
  - Pulse animation overlay on icons
  - Text color transitions
  - Horizontal translation on card hover
- Animations are triggered by existing intersection observer setup

All changes maintain consistency with the landing page's glassmorphism design and animation style from v0.dev.

## Survey Enhancement Implementation Review

### 4. Implemented Queue Management
- Created QueuedRecommendations component with collapsible UI
- Queue persists in localStorage (with database migration prepared)
- Shows after search results for easy access
- Users can search or remove items from queue

### 5. Enhanced Recommendation Generation
- Updated algorithm to use interests + usage patterns for contextual recommendations
- Added usage-based topic templates (career, investment, research, etc.)
- Generates more personalized and relevant recommendations
- Added 13 new topic categories with 6-8 topics each

### 6. Improved User Flow

# TODO: Fix TypeScript Errors - Implicit 'any' Types in Event Handlers

## Overview
Fix all TypeScript errors where event handler parameters implicitly have 'any' type in Index.tsx. These are mainly for parameter 'e' in various event handlers.

## Tasks

### Fix Event Handler Type Annotations
- [x] Line 859: `onClick={(e) => {` - Add proper type for click event
- [x] Line 1076: `onClick={(e) => {` - Add proper type for click event  
- [x] Line 1117: `onChange={(e) => {` - Add proper type for change event
- [x] Line 1120: `onKeyPress={(e) => {` - Add proper type for keyboard event
- [x] Line 1318: `onChange={(e) => setChatInput(e.target.value)}` - Add proper type
- [x] Line 1319: `onKeyPress={(e) => {` - Add proper type for keyboard event
- [x] Line 1366: `onClick={(e) => {` - Add proper type for click event
- [x] Line 1626: `onChange={(e) => setTopic(e.target.value)}` - Add proper type
- [x] Line 1627: `onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleSynthesize()}` - Add proper type
- [x] Line 1659: `onChange={(e) => {` - Add proper type for change event

### Additional Implicit 'any' Fixes
- [x] Line 575: `catch((err) =>` - Added Error type
- [x] Line 971: `onValueChange={(value) =>` - Added string type
- [x] Line 1039: `map((paragraph, idx) =>` - Added string and number types

## Event Type Reference
- Click events on buttons: `React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`
- Click events on divs: `React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>`
- Change events on input: `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`
- Change events on textarea: `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>`
- KeyPress events on input: `React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>`
- KeyPress events on textarea: `React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>`

## Implementation Notes
- Import React types if needed
- Ensure each event handler has proper typing
- Test that all functionality still works after adding types

## Review

Successfully fixed all TypeScript errors related to implicit 'any' types in event handlers in Index.tsx:

### Event Handler Type Fixes
1. **Click Events on Buttons** - Added `React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>` type to 3 button click handlers
2. **Change Events** - Added proper types:
   - `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>` for input elements (3 instances)
   - `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>` for textarea element (1 instance)
3. **Keyboard Events** - Added proper types:
   - `React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>` for input elements (2 instances)
   - `React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>` for textarea element (1 instance)

### Additional Implicit 'any' Fixes
1. **Error Handler** - Added `Error` type to catch block parameter
2. **Callback Parameters** - Added explicit types:
   - `string` type for `onValueChange` callback parameter
   - `string` and `number` types for `map` function parameters

All changes maintain the existing functionality while providing proper TypeScript type safety. The code now has explicit types for all event handlers and callback parameters, eliminating the implicit 'any' type errors.

# Clean Up Unused Imports and Variables in Index.tsx - COMPLETED

## Review

Successfully removed all unused imports and variables from Index.tsx:

### Removed Imports:
1. **React** - Not needed with modern JSX transform
2. **Shield** - Icon not used in the component
3. **User** - Icon not used in the component
4. **UserMenu** - Component not used
5. **supabase** - Not directly used in the component

### Removed Variables:
1. **chatVisible/setChatVisible** - State was declared but never used
2. **refreshCount** - Only incremented but never read, removed both state and setter
3. **dailySearchCount** - Deconstructed from useSubscription but never used

### Preserved Functionality:
- All existing features continue to work
- Navigation state handling for search topics remains intact
- Refresh button still works without refreshCount state

The code is now cleaner with no warnings about unused imports or variables.
