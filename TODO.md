# AI Model Improvement Plan

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Update News Synthesis Prompts
- Increased temperature from 0.2 to 0.7 for more natural variation
- Removed rigid word count requirements (changed "EXACTLY 300-350" to "Around 300-400")
- Added style guidance to avoid common AI phrases
- Included specific examples of good vs bad writing
- Made paragraph structure more flexible

### ✅ 2. Enhance System Prompts with Style Examples  
- Added concrete examples of good and bad openings, transitions, and conclusions
- Emphasized writing like modern digital publications (The Verge, Axios, Morning Brew)
- Instructed to vary sentence and paragraph lengths naturally

### ✅ 3. Update Q&A Function
- Increased temperature from 0.5 to 0.7
- Removed "helpful assistant" language
- Added specific phrases to avoid (Certainly!, Indeed!, etc.)
- Emphasized conversational, colleague-to-colleague tone

### ✅ 4. Refine Debate Generation
- Increased temperature from 0.8 to 0.85
- Removed strict word count requirements
- Added natural speech elements (interruptions, verbal tics, filler words)
- Updated personas for Trump and Musk to sound more authentic
- Made exchanges more flexible and conversational

### ✅ 5. Consider Model Upgrades
- Added comments in all three functions showing upgrade paths:
  - gpt-4-turbo: ~10x cost, better reasoning
  - gpt-4o: ~30x cost, best quality
  - Claude models: Alternative option (requires different API setup)

### ✅ 6. Add Post-Processing
- Created cleanAIPhrasings() function to remove common AI phrases
- Automatically cleans articles, headlines after generation
- Replaces overused terms with simpler alternatives
- Fixes formatting issues from phrase removal

## Review Summary

All changes focused on making AI output sound more natural and less "AI-ey" by:

1. **Higher Temperature**: All functions now use 0.7-0.85 temperature for more variation
2. **Flexible Structure**: Removed rigid word counts and paragraph requirements
3. **Style Guidance**: Added specific instructions to avoid AI clichés
4. **Natural Speech**: Especially in debates, added interruptions and verbal tics
5. **Post-Processing**: Clean up common AI phrases after generation
6. **Easy Testing**: Model upgrade paths clearly documented for A/B testing

The news synthesis function received the most attention since that's where users specifically complained about "AI-ey" content. The combination of prompt improvements and post-processing should significantly improve output quality while keeping costs low with gpt-4o-mini.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Deploy these changes to test environment
2. Generate sample articles with old vs new prompts
3. A/B test user satisfaction
4. If needed, test gpt-4-turbo for critical content
5. Monitor API costs vs quality improvements
