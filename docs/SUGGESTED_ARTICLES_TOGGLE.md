## Suggested Articles module toggle

The home page "Suggested Articles Based on Your Interests" section is currently disabled.

- Toggle flag: set `SHOW_SUGGESTED_ARTICLES` to `true` in `src/pages/Index.tsx`.
- Current default: `false` (section hidden).

After flipping the flag back to `true`, rebuild or reload the app and the cards will render again without any additional migrations.
